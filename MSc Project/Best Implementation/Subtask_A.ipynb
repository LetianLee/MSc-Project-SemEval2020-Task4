    "# Best Implementation on Subtask A: Validation\n",
    "Last updated on September 10, 2021.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Project Information:\n",
    "* Summer Project: Commonsense Validation and Explanation in Natural Language Processing<br>\n",
    "* Objective Task: SemEval 2020 Task 4 - Commonsense Validation and Explanation (ComVE)<br>\n",
    "* Supervisor: Dr Mark Lee<br>\n",
    "* Student: Letian Li (2214560)\n",
    " \n",
    "#### Task Description:\n",
    "The subtask A is a validation task. The purpose is to determine which of two similar natural language statements is against common sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example:*  \n",
    "> Task: Which of the two statements is against common sense?  \n",
    "> Statement1: He put a turkey into the fridge.  \n",
    "> Statement2: He put an elephant into the fridge. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution:\n",
    "This program will follow the steps:\n",
    "1. General Preparation  \n",
    "2. Data Processing \n",
    "3. Loading the Model and Optimizer  \n",
    "4. Training \n",
    "5. Testing \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Please Note:  \n",
    "1. In this implementation work, there is no validation process, because it has been carried out in the experiment work. Here, the validation dataset will be used as the training dataset to improve the performance of the best implementation.  \n",
    "2. The optimal model and hyperparameters selected by the experiment require large storage (about 19G) on the GPU. If you just want to see how this implementation works, you can use a smaller model and batch size."
