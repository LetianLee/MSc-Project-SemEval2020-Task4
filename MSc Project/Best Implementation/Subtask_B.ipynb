    "# Best Implementation on Subtask B: Explanation (Multi-Choice)\n",
    "Updated on August 20, 2021.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Project Information:\n",
    "* Summer Project: Commonsense Validation and Explanation in Natural Language Processing<br>\n",
    "* Objective Task: SemEval 2020 Task 4 - Commonsense Validation and Explanation (ComVE)<br>\n",
    "* Supervisor: Dr Mark Lee<br>\n",
    "* Student: Letian Li (2214560)\n",
    " \n",
    "#### Task Description:\n",
    "The subtask B is an Explanation (Multi-Choice) task. The purpose is to find the right reason why a given statement is against common sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example:*  \n",
    "> **Task:** Select the most appropriate reason as to why this statement is against common sense.  \n",
    "> **Statement:** He put an elephant into the fridge.  \n",
    "> A: An elephant is much bigger than a fridge.  \n",
    "> B: Elephants are usually white while fridges are usually white.  \n",
    "> C: An elephant cannot eat a fridge.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution:\n",
    "This program will follow the steps:\n",
    "1. General Preparation  \n",
    "2. Data Processing \n",
    "3. Loading the Model and Optimizer  \n",
    "4. Training \n",
    "5. Testing \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Please Note:  \n",
    "1. In this implementation work, there is no validation process, because it has been carried out in the experiment work. Here, the validation dataset will be used as the training dataset to improve the performance of the best implementation.  \n",
    "2. The optimal model and hyperparameters selected by the experiment require large storage (over 20G) on the GPU. If you just want to see how this implementation works, you can use a smaller model and batch size."
